# Program.cmake contains all the logics needed to find all the
# necessary software and tools that are being used during the
# configuration, building, and deployment of JASP.
#
# On Linux,
#   CMake makes sure that the Compiler, etc. exists, and beyond
#   that we are looking for a few other tools, e.g., gfortran
#   that is required for building some of the R packages.
#
# On macOS,
#   Beyond the Xcode, which is being verified by CMake, we are
#   expecting two third party tools, `create-dmg` and `parallel`
#
# On Windows,
#   We need to make sure that MinGW and MSYS2 environment exists,
#   and that we can find it. In addition, we look binaries of
#   WIX Toolset.
#     - If CMake cannot find either of the heat, candle, or light
#       executable, you can use the `WIX_PATH` variable to nudge
#       it to the right directory.
